## Team Alpha: 1st place in national challenge to combat Fake New

It is in times of elections that fake news impact the most. As Mexico approaches its presidential election, social networks become flooded with rumors and false stories aimed to misinform the voting population.

Different efforts have been made in order to alleviate this problem. News media agencies have teamed up in an unprecedented way in order to verify news. However, we felt that having just a website full of verified news wasn't going to be enough to inform the people. That is why we created a bot that recollects political information and displays it inside the same social network that the user would be navigating.

Team Alpha would like to thank Actúa and FEITESM for bringing all the presidential candidates to the Tecnológico de Monterrey campus and for hosting this national challenge that has ultimately sparked a flame in every member of the team to combat fake news.
