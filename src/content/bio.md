If I had to summarize who I am in a couple of sentences, it would go something like this:

> An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism#Optimalism" target="_blank">optimalist</a>, activist and a tech lover. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifelong_learning" target="_blank">Lifelong Learner</a>, looking to build cool stuff with cool people.

And, since there's no character limit in my own blog, I'll just go ahead and list other fun stuff about me.

Some of my hobbies include playing soccer with my friends, making digital drawings, playing the guitar, traveling the world, and meeting new people.
