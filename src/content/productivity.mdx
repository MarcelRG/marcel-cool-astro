As the world becomes increasingly digital, it's no surprise that we are turning to technology to help us be more productive. From task management tools to time tracking software, there are a plethora of options available to help us get things done more efficiently.

One popular approach to boosting productivity is to create a "productivity stack," a collection of tools and apps that work together to help you manage your time and get more done. Here are most of the tools Here's my personal productivity stack:

## TickTick

Not to be confused with the popular social media app TikTok, TickTick is probably the most versatile to-do list I've ever tried. Date parsing, priority sorting, habit tracker, calendar views and productivity statistics are some of the features that I really like. But by far, my favorite feature is the Pomodoro Timer, which allows you to track at what times you've been the most productive.

## Notion

I use notion primarily for the following two purposes:
Notion is a powerful tool that can be used as a "second brain" to help you capture and organize your thoughts, ideas, and tasks. It's designed to be an all-in-one workspace that can help you manage your projects, notes, and tasks in one place.

One of the key benefits of using Notion as a second brain is its flexibility. You can customize your workspace to fit your specific needs, creating custom pages and databases to organize and track your work. This makes it easy to capture and organize your ideas and tasks in a way that works for you.

I mainly use Notion for two of the following reasons: Or to create a kanban board to track the things I need to be working on inside a project. Kanban board to keep track of feautres I'd like to build inside a project. Oddly enough I don't really like the pure note taking experience. Slow and cumbersome to set up.
